	REPOST
	======

repost is a script to perform simple tasks on all of your repositories at once.

It requires only php cli to run.
Run it with no arguments to see available options, eg.

Usage: repost <action>
Actions:
        list    list repositories
        pull    pull repositories from origin
        push    push repositories to origin
        status  show statuses

Repost reads the configuration from the '.repost' file in your home directory.
The config file contains a list of directories to look for repositories
(only git and svn at the moment) and an optional set of custom commands to
perform instead of the default ones.

Example .repost file
--------------------

 repobase = "/home/me/Projects:/share/workrepos"

 #example custom command
 #cmd.status.svn = "svn status --xml"
