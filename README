	repos-tools: perform simple tasks on your repositories
	======================================================

A couple of utilities to work faster and easier on your code repositories:

* repost: push, pull, build and do things on all of your repos, or some of them
* github: command line client to github issues, following, watching, etc

All of them are written in php and can be run from the shell prompt.

repost
------

repost is a script to perform simple tasks on your repositories at once.

Run it with no arguments to see available options:

Usage: repost <action> [<repolist>]
Actions:
    build   build with make or ant
    diff    show what's changed in your working directories
    list    list repositories
    log     show last commit logs
    pull    pull repositories from origin/parent
    push    push repositories to origin/parent
    status  show statuses
<repolist> can be one of:
    * all   (the default) apply command to all the repositories
    * a comma separated list of repository names and/or types.
      Eg.   repost build repo1,repo2        => builds repositories repo1 and repo2
            repost push git:                => push all Git repositories to origin

Repost reads the configuration from the '.repost' file in your home directory.
The config file contains a list of directories to look for repositories
(Git, Subversion and Bazaar at the moment) and an optional set of custom commands
to perform instead of the default ones.

Example .repost file:

#---------BEGIN EXAMPLE-------------#
 repobase = "/home/me/Projects:/share/workrepos"

 #example custom command
 #cmd.status.svn = "svn status --xml"

#---------END EXAMPLE---------------#


github
------

github is a command line client to some of the github's features.

Run it with no arguments to see available options:

Usage: github <command> [<args>]
commands:
        clone   <repo> clones the specified repository
        create  <name> create a public repository called <name>
        fork    <repo> fork a repository
        info    get info on my network and watched repositories
        issues  list (lists all open issues) or:
                {comment|close} <issue #> [<comment>]
                (uses the repository you're working on)
        follow  <user> start following an user
        followers       list my followers
        unfollow        <user> stop following an user
        unwatch <repo> stop watching a repository
        watch   <repo> start watching a repository
