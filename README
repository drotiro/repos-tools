	repos-tools: perform simple tasks on your repositories
	======================================================

A couple of utilities to work faster and easier on your code repositories:

* repost: push, pull, build and do things on all of your repos, or some of them
* github: command line client to github issues, following, watching, etc

They need the PHP cli. github also needs the cURL extension.

repost
------

repost is a script to perform simple tasks on your repositories at once.

Run it with no arguments to see available options:

Usage: repost <action> [<repolist>]
Actions:
    build   build with make or ant
    diff    show what's changed in your working directories
    list    list repositories
    log     show last commit logs
    pull    pull repositories from origin/parent
    push    push repositories to origin/parent
    status  show statuses
<repolist> can be one of:
    * all   (the default) apply command to all the repositories
    * this	apply command the the current working directory
    * a comma separated list of repository names and/or types.
      Eg.   repost build repo1,repo2        => builds repositories repo1 and repo2
            repost push git:                => push all Git repositories to origin
or you can execute any command with 'repost do <repolist> <command>'

Repost reads the configuration from the '.repost' file in your home directory.
The config file contains a list of directories to look for repositories
(Git, Subversion, Bazaar and Mercurial) and an optional set of custom commands
to perform instead of the default ones.

Example .repost file:

#---------BEGIN EXAMPLE-------------#
 repobase = "/home/me/Projects:/share/workrepos"

 #example custom command
 #cmd.status.svn = "svn status --xml"

#---------END EXAMPLE---------------#


github
------

github is a command line client to some of the github's features.

Run it with no arguments to see available options:

Usage: github <command> [<args>]
commands:
   clone <repo>     	clone a repository
   create <name>    	create a public repository
   fork <repo>      	fork a repository
   forkc <repo>     	fork a repository and clone your copy
   info [<user>]    	get info on a github user (on me by default)
   issues (*)       	list (lists all open issues) or:
                        {comment|close} <issue #> [<comment>]
   follow <user>    	start following an user
   followers [<user>]	list followers of <user> (mine by default)
   news              	show your private feed
   rinfo (*)        	info on this repository
   unfollow <user>  	stop following an user
   unwatch <repo>   	stop watching a repository
   watch <repo>     	start watching a repository
   watchers (*)     	list watchers
commands marked with (*) must be run from a working dir.
