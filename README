	repos-tools: perform simple tasks on your repositories
	======================================================

repost is a script to perform simple tasks on all of your repositories at once.

It requires only php cli to run.
Run it with no arguments to see available options, eg.

Usage: repost <action>
Actions:
        build   build with make or ant
        diff    show what's changed in your working directories
        list    list repositories
        log     show last commit logs
        pull    pull repositories from origin/parent
        push    push repositories to origin/parent
        status  show statuses

Repost reads the configuration from the '.repost' file in your home directory.
The config file contains a list of directories to look for repositories
(Git, Subversion and Bazaar at the moment) and an optional set of custom commands
to perform instead of the default ones.

Example .repost file
--------------------

 repobase = "/home/me/Projects:/share/workrepos"

 #example custom command
 #cmd.status.svn = "svn status --xml"
