repos-tools: perform simple tasks on your repositories
======================================================

A couple of utilities to work faster and easier on your code repositories:

* __github__: command line client to github issues, following, watching, etc
* __repost__: push, pull, build and do things on all of your repos, or some of them

They need the PHP cli. github also needs the cURL extension.

See the [wiki](http://github.com/drotiro/repos-tools/wiki) for documentation and examples.
